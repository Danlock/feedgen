# Feedgen

Generates RSS/Atom/JSON feeds for manga.

Currently hosted at feedgen.xyz

The idea is that you enter in list of manga titles, and you receive a link to a feed that can be placed in a feed reader of your choice (Thunderbird, QuiteRSS, etc). Currently the feeds are populated by looking at the mangaupdates.com releases page, which I've found to be the most up to date source. If you have any other ideas, feel free to mention it in an issue.

This project was mainly an excuse to try out goa V2, go-swagger, go modules and CockroachDB. I may add further media in the future.
